# Interview Tests

This directory contains all technical assessments used by Hands In during the interview process. Each test is designed for specific roles and evaluates different technical competencies.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
The fastest way to set up any test is using GitHub Codespaces:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/hands-in/interview-repo?quickstart=1)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/hands-in/interview-repo.git
cd interview-repo
pnpm install

# Run a specific test (example with weather app)
nx dev weather       # Start development server
nx test weather      # Run tests
nx test weather --watch  # Run tests in watch mode for TDD
```

## üéØ Test Categories

### Full-Stack Development
- **[Next.js Weather App](./nextjs-weather/)**: React/Next.js application testing full-stack development skills
  - **Skills Tested**: TypeScript, API design, error handling, testing, responsive UI
  - **Time**: 1-2 hours
  - **Commands**: `nx dev weather`, `nx test weather --watch`

## üìã Test Administration Guidelines

### For Interviewers

#### Pre-Test Setup
1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Ensure the candidate has access to the repository
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Test that the development environment works
   - Prepare any necessary API keys or external resources

2. **Time Management**
   - Each test directory specifies estimated completion time
   - Allow buffer time for questions and environment setup
   - Consider candidate's experience level when setting expectations

3. **Communication Guidelines**
   - Clarify that questions are encouraged
   - Explain the evaluation process
   - Set clear expectations about deliverables

#### During the Test
- **Observation Points**:
  - How does the candidate approach problem-solving?
  - Do they read documentation thoroughly?
  - How do they handle unexpected issues?
  - What questions do they ask?

- **Available Support**:
  - Answer clarifying questions about requirements
  - Help with environment setup issues
  - Provide guidance on tooling if needed
  - Do not provide solution hints or implementation guidance

#### Post-Test Evaluation
- **Technical Assessment**:
  - Code quality and organization
  - Problem-solving approach
  - Use of best practices
  - Test coverage and quality

- **Soft Skills Assessment**:
  - Communication during the process
  - Question quality and frequency
  - Time management
  - Adaptability to feedback

## üîß Test Environment Setup

Each test includes its own setup instructions, but general requirements include:

### Software Requirements
- Node.js 22
- pnpm package manager
- Git
- Modern web browser
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Common Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies for all tests
pnpm install

# Run a specific test's development server
nx dev [test-name]           # e.g., nx dev weather

# Run tests
nx test [test-name]          # e.g., nx test weather
nx test [test-name] --watch  # Run in watch mode for TDD

# Build production version
nx build [test-name]         # e.g., nx build weather
```
