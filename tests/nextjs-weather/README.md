## 🧪 Development Approach: TDD/BDD

This test is designed to be completed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** principles:

### 1. Start with Tests (Red Phase)
```bash
# Run tests to see what needs to be implemented
nx test weather --watch
```

The provided test file contains test cases that define the expected behavior. Review the test names to understand the requirements, then implement functionality to make tests pass.

### 2. Implement Functionality (Green Phase)
Write the minimal code needed to make each test pass:

1. **WeatherService Implementation**
   - Create a class that implements the `WeatherService` interface
   - Use the provided sample data from `weatherData.ts`
   - Implement getWeather and updateWeather methods

2. **API Routes Implementation**
   - Implement GET `/api/weather` endpoint with query parameters
   - Implement POST `/api/weather` endpoint for updates
   - Add proper validation and error responses

3. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Build UI components that consume your API
   - Add proper loading states and error handling
   - Make the interface responsive and accessible

### 3. Refactor and Improve (Refactor Phase)
- Clean up code and improve structure
- Add additional error handling
- Optimize performance
- Enhance user experience

## 🎯 Implementation Approach

### Recommended Order
1. **Start with Backend** - Implement WeatherService class and API endpoints
2. **Test as You Go** - Use the provided tests to guide your implementation
3. **Complete Frontend** - Finish the update weather form integration
4. **Refine and Test** - Add error handling and edge case coverage

### Phase 1: Core Backend (Essential)
- Implement WeatherService class with getWeather and updateWeather methods
- Complete GET and POST API endpoints in `route.ts`
- Ensure proper error handling and validation

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Essential)
- Complete the update weather form submission in `weather/update/page.tsx`
- Test both demo pages work with your API implementation

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality (Essential)
- Implement the test cases in `WeatherService.test.ts`
- Add error handling tests
- Ensure code quality and TypeScript compliance

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I implement all the tests at once?**
A: No! Follow TDD - implement one test at a time, make it pass, then move to the next.

**Q: Can I modify the sample data?**
A: You can extend it, but don't remove existing data as tests may depend on it.

**Q: How detailed should error handling be?**
A: Comprehensive - handle invalid inputs, missing data, and edge cases gracefully.

**Q: Should I focus more on frontend or backend?**
A: Both are important, but start with backend (API) as the frontend depends on it.

**Q: What if I don't finish everything?**
A: Quality over quantity - focus on doing fewer things well rather than rushing through everything.
